# MdataPicPrep

This is a python program for picture data preperation. 

It cuts the picture file in the size you want. Than formats it how you want it and than saves it in:

--> .mat Matlap files 
and/or 
-->.hdr (TO DO dynamic Format)..... HDR pictures 
and/or
-->.png (TO DO dynamic Format)..... SDR pictures

as you wish. 


I would recomend installing the python managment program anaconda with

========> pip install conda

more info:
https://pypi.org/project/conda/

and than install the requirements.txt, because the program imports a lot of packages not preinstalled in python3 library

to add all the librarys type 

pip install -r requirements.txt (TO DO add requirements.txt)

Options to run the program:

1. Option:
If you want to use MdataPicPrep with jupyter you can copy it and just start it.

2. Option: Type in your comandline toole, if you have python3 and all requirements installed: 

====> python3 main_format.py 

and answer all the questions and enjoy :).
