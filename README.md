# MdataPicPrep

This is a python program for data preperation. 
You can outputs Matlap files and/or .hdr and .png pictures of the same picture patch.

I would recomend installing the python managment program anaconda with

========> pip install conda

more info:
https://pypi.org/project/conda/

You should install the requirements.txt because the program imports a lot of packages not preinstalled in python3

just type 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

Options to run the program:

1. Option:
If you want to use MdataPicPrep with jupyter you can copy it and just start it.

2. Option: Type in your comandline toole, if you have python3 and all requirements installed: 

====> python3 main_format.py 

and answer the questions
